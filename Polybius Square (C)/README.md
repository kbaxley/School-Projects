These two programs function on the Polybius square cipher. Where a cipher is created by placing each letter of the 
English alphabet randomly into each slot of a 5x5 square. Since there are 26 letters and only 25 spaces, one letter 
is chosen by the cipher creator to represent two letters. Once all the letters are in place, they are assigned numbers
based on their x,y coordinates within the grid. These numbers are used to create the cipher which are then deciphered 
using the same key. 

Encrypt takes a string input and outputs the number pair cipher.
Decrypt takes a number pair cipher input and outputs the deciphered string.
