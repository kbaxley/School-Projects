# Bombs Away

Summary: 

The assignment was to demonstrate the fundamentals of writing code (lists, loops, user input, etc.). Myself and my partner Alex opted to meet these requirements through a game of our own design called "Bombs Away." It's sort of a mash-up between Minesweeper and Battleship. Like Battleship, the objective is to input 2-D grid coordinates in order to "bomb" the enemy. But like Minesweeper, the enemy coordinates only occupy a single spot on the grid. But unlike both of these games, there is a limited amount of guesses before losing the game. 

The game and the code could be expanded greatly but I'm gonna keep it how it is as a benchmark to see how my knowledge and skills improve over time. I remember coding this up and thinking it was a doozy of a project, since then I've coded some more complex OOP type programs. It is very exciting to see the progress made after just one year of CS classes. I can't wait to see what I will be capable of after graduation. 

Technical Description: 

The entire game is text based and takes place entirely within the terminal. The majority of the game is written within a while loop within one function. There is another function but it's really only utilized to create random enemy coordinates.
