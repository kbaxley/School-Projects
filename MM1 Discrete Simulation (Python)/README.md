This M/M/1 queue simulator simulates the Disney "Fast-Pass" system by using the discrete-event approach and simulates both high-load and
low-load and outputs each result in PDF form. The results show the optimal percentage of fast-pass tickets that can be sold before
wait times equalizes between fast-pass lanes and normal lanes.
