Hash Crack takes a brute-force approach to breaking a hashed string. 

The program takes a hashed string and file name as input. The filename
is just where the program stores its output. It then scans through a dictionary
of words and hashes each one until it finds one that matches. If no match is
found, then it tries some variations including numbers at the end of the word
and l33t variations of the word.
