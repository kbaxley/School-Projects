The linked list decryptor was a final assignment to utilize a linked list as a decryption method.

The input text would be jumbled in such a way that the de-cyphering would involve taking the first
letter of the input text and placing it to the right of the first character then the next character
would be placed to the left of that, so on and so forth for each word. For example, an input text of
"alnp" would decypher to "plan" and an input text of "xetn" would decypher to "next". 

The requirement was to demonstrate knowledge of how to create a LinkedList class from scratch and 
build methods to modify said list. 

Decryptor.java is the driver class that utilizes the LinkedList and Node classes. The driver takes an
input .txt file with each phrase separated by a line and each word separated by an asterisk and prints
out the decrypted message.
